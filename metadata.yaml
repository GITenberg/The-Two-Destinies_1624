description: Do you believe in fate? Is true love powerful enough to overcome even
  the most adverse of circumstances? These thought-provoking questions form the thematic
  core of the novel The Two Destinies by master storyteller Wilkie Collins. Two star-crossed
  lovers fall head-over-heels for one another, but soon fall prey to a seemingly insurmountable
  series of mishaps and misadventures. Will they wind up together eventually?
